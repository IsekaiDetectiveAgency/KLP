1.KLP stands for Kotlin Learning Projects and as the name suggests these are the projects i made for the sake of learning kotling

2.to run the .jar files:
Windows:right click and run by java
Linux: open the console in the same directory as the .jar and run: java -jar AppName.jar (replace AppName with the name of your desired .jar app)
Mac: idk just somehow run it using java
android: .jar files aren't made for android but you can run them using a terminal app for example:termux and open the .jar app like in Linux (most likely installing java on the terminal app is required)
